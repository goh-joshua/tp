## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="400" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [
`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [
`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [_`UI`_](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [_`Logic`_](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [_`Model`_](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [_`Storage`_](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[_`Commons`_](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

### How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete-a n/LeBron s/Basketball`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface.
Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to
prevent outside components from being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial)
class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [
`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component" width="800"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `AthleteListPanel`,
`OrganizationListPanel`, `ContractListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between
classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [
`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [
`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Athlete`, `Organization`, and `Contract` objects
  residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [
`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:
<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550" height="375"/>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

The sequence diagrams below illustrate the interactions within the `Logic` component,
taking the `add-a` and `delete-a` commands as examples.

<puml src="diagrams/AlternateAddAthleteSD.puml" width="650" />
<puml src="diagrams/ParsingAddSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />
<puml src="diagrams/AlternateDeleteAthleteSD.puml" width="650" />
<puml src="diagrams/ParsingDeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it passes the user input to an `AddressBookParser` object, which
   in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `AddAthleteCommandParser` or `DeleteAthleteCommandParser`)
   and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an instance of one of its subclasses such as
   `AddAthleteCommand` or `DeleteAthleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command communicates with the `Model` when executed (e.g., to add or delete an athlete).
   Although this is shown as a single step in the diagrams above for simplicity, the actual implementation involves
   multiple interactions between the `Command` and the `Model`.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object, which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing user commands:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser`
  (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddAthleteCommandParser`,
  `AddOrganizationCommandParser`,
  `AddContractCommandParser`, `DeleteAthleteCommandParser`, etc.), which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddAthleteCommand`).
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddAthleteCommandParser`, `DeleteAthleteCommandParser`,
  `AddOrganizationCommandParser`)
  implement the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated uniformly (e.g., during testing).

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [
`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the application data — i.e., all `Athlete`, `Organization`, and `Contract` objects, which are contained in
  `UniqueAthleteList`, `UniqueOrganizationList`, and `UniqueContractList` objects respectively.
- stores the currently “selected” data (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists, which are exposed
  to the outside as unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` objects (for example, `ObservableList<Athlete>`). This allows the UI
  to automatically update when the underlying data changes.
- stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents domain data that should make sense
  independently of other layers).

### Storage component

**API** : [
`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both application data (including `Athlete`, `Organization`, and `Contract` information) and user preference
  data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one if only
  the functionality of one is needed.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, because the `Storage` component’s job is to save and retrieve
  objects that belong to the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### Data Types and Overflow Protection

**Contract Amount Handling**

The application has been designed to handle large contract amounts that are common in professional sports:

* **Data Type**: Contract amounts use `long` integers (64-bit) instead of `int` (32-bit)
* **Maximum Value**: Up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (approximately 9.2 quintillion)
* **Limit Applied**: Both individual contract amounts and total contract amounts for an athlete or organization cannot
  exceed this maximum value
* **Overflow Protection**: The `ensureNoTotalOverflow()` method validates total contract amounts using predicate-based
  filtering and checks both athlete and organization totals before adding new contracts
* **Validation Logic**: Uses `sumForPredicate()` to calculate current totals and `wouldOverflow()` to detect if adding a
  new contract would exceed the maximum limit
* **UI Display**: Contract totals are properly formatted using `NumberFormat` for large amounts

**Why `long` Instead of `int`**

* **Real-world Requirements**: Professional sports contracts can exceed $2 billion (`int` limit: ~2.1 billion)
* **Cumulative Totals**: Popular athletes/organizations can have total contracts exceeding `int` limits
* **Future-proofing**: Protects against inflation and larger contract values
* **Error Prevention**: Eliminates negative overflow display bugs in UI chips

## **Implementation**

This section describes noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

---

### **[Implemented] Find command**

The **Find** command enables users to perform keyword-based searches across different data types within the system —  
athletes, organizations, and contracts — using flexible, case-insensitive, and fuzzy matching.  
It temporarily filters the displayed lists in memory without altering any saved data.

---

The `FindCommand` extends `Command` and is invoked with one required flag that specifies the **search scope**.  
The following flags are supported:

| Flag  | Description                          |
|-------|--------------------------------------|
| `-an` | Finds athletes by name               |
| `-as` | Finds athletes by sport              |
| `-on` | Finds organizations by name          |
| `-ca` | Finds contracts by athlete name      |
| `-co` | Finds contracts by organization name |
| `-cs` | Finds contracts by sport             |

Example usage:

```
find -an Lionel
```

Upon execution, the command:

1. Validates that exactly one flag is present.
2. Extracts the keyword and normalizes it to lowercase.
3. Delegates filtering to an appropriate method in `Model`, depending on the flag.
4. Applies a **multi-tier fuzzy-matching predicate** combining substring and Levenshtein-distance checks.
5. Constructs a `CommandResult` reporting how many entities matched.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="FindSequenceDiagram-Logic" width="750" />

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

---

#### Search scopes and behavior

Each flag maps to a `SearchScope` enum constant that defines:

- A label (e.g., “athletes”, “organizations”, “contracts”)
- The `UiTab` to display in the interface
- A custom `apply(Model, keyword)` implementation that calls the relevant model filter

This enum-based design ensures that each scope encapsulates its filtering logic neatly within a single override,
improving maintainability and readability.

<puml src="diagrams/FindScopeClassDiagram.puml" alt="FindScopeClassDiagram" width="700" />

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

---

#### Matching logic

The matching mechanism performs **three-tier Levenshtein-based fuzzy matching** implemented within the command itself:

1. **Exact substring check** — returns a match if the keyword appears as a case-insensitive substring.
2. **Full-text Levenshtein match** — compares the entire field value against the keyword, allowing a small number of
   edits based on keyword length.
3. **Word-by-word Levenshtein match** — splits the text into words and matches each token individually.

This approach allows tolerant and human-friendly searches (e.g., `find -an leo` matches “Lionel Messi”;
`find -co arsnal` matches “Arsenal”).

<puml src="diagrams/FindMatchingActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FindMatchingActivityDiagram" width="700" />

<box type="info" seamless>
<strong>Note:</strong>  
The command only affects filtered views in memory.  
Persistent data stored on disk remains unchanged.
</box>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

---

#### Example flow

The following scenario demonstrates how a typical command executes:

**Step 1.** The user executes `find -co Arsenal`.  
**Step 2.** The parser constructs a `FindCommand` with scope `CONTRACT_ORGANIZATION` and keyword `Arsenal`.  
**Step 3.** The command invokes `model.updateFilteredContractList(predicate)`.  
**Step 4.** The UI’s observable list updates, displaying all contracts linked to organizations matching “Arsenal”.  
**Step 5.** A `CommandResult` reports the number of matching contracts and switches the active tab to **Contracts**.

<puml src="diagrams/FindActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FindActivityDiagram" width="500" />

---

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How search scope is determined**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an enum (`SearchScope`) with one method per scope.
    - Pros: Compact, type-safe, easily extensible for new scopes.
    - Cons: Slightly more complex when flags overlap semantically.
- **Alternative 2:** Use a single switch statement on the flag.
    - Pros: Simple and direct for small command sets.
    - Cons: Harder to extend; increases method size.

**Aspect: Matching method**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Custom Levenshtein-based fuzzy match with multi-tier logic.
    - Pros: Natural partial and typo-tolerant matches without external libraries.
    - Cons: Slightly higher computational cost on large datasets.
- **Alternative 2:** Simple exact or tokenized substring match.
    - Pros: Faster and easier to reason about.
    - Cons: Misses partial and typo-tolerant results.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 athletes, organizations, and contracts while maintaining an average response time
   of under 2 seconds for common operations (e.g., adding, deleting, or searching) under typical usage conditions.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands), typically
   around 50–60 words per minute (WPM), should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using
   the mouse.
4. Should validate all input data (e.g., names, emails, dates, amounts) and provide clear error messages when invalid
   input is detected.
5. Should allow the application to be packaged and distributed in a portable format (e.g., JAR or Docker container) for
   ease of deployment across environments.
6. Should allow a new user to perform basic operations (e.g., adding, deleting and finding athletes, organizations,
   and contracts) within 10 minutes of using the application, by following the provided user guide.
7. Should provide consistent response times (<2 seconds) for retrieval commands such as searching athletes,
   organizations, or contracts under normal usage load.
8. Should prevent duplicate records by enforcing unique key constraints (e.g., same athlete name + sport).

### Glossary

* **Athlete**: An individual sports performer managed by the agent, with contact details and sport specialization.
* **Command Line Interface**: A text-based interface that allows users to interact with the application by typing commands.
* **Contract**: A business agreement between an athlete and organization, including financial terms and duration.
* **Fuzzy Matching**: A search method that finds results even with typos or partial matches, using intelligent algorithms.
* **Graphical User Interface**: visual interface that allows users to interact with the application through graphical elements such as buttons, menus, and icons.
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Organization**: Any business entity that contracts with athletes - teams, sponsors, agencies, brands, etc.
* **Sports Agent**: A professional who represents athletes in contract negotiations and career management.

### Saving data

#### 1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

##### 1.1 Simulate a missing file

1. Close playbook.io.
2. Navigate to the `data` folder.
3. Delete one or more JSON files (e.g., `athletelist.json`, `contractlist.json`, `organizationlist.json`).
4. Re-launch playbook.io.

**Expected:**

- If `contractlist.json` is not empty but one or more of the other files are missing, all JSON files are re-generated as
  empty lists.
- Otherwise, only the missing files are automatically generated as empty lists.

##### 1.2 Simulate a corrupted file

1. Open a JSON file (e.g., `athletelist.json`).
2. Add invalid content (e.g., remove a closing bracket or insert invalid characters).
3. Save the file and relaunch playbook.io.

**Expected:**
The app detects that the files are corrupted and loads empty lists for all entities.

> **⚠️ Important:**
> New JSON files are only created once data is written (e.g., after adding an athlete, contract, or organization).

#### 2. Normal save

##### 2.1 Simulate saving data after adding entries

1. Open playbook.io.
2. Add an athlete, contract, or organization
3. Close playbook.io.

**Expected:**
Data is persisted correctly in the JSON files.
