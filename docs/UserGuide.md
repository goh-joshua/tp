### Finding & Filtering Data

The search functionality uses **fuzzy matching** to help you find what you're looking for, even with typos or partial names.

#### Search Command

**Command:** `find -[FLAG] KEYWORD`
**Parameters:**
- `KEYWORD`: Keyword to be searched (spaces allowed, case-insensitive; cannot be blank or consist of only spaces)
  **Available Search Types:**

| Flag  | Searches                  | Example               |
| ----- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `-an` | Athlete names             | `find -an LeBron`     |
| `-as` | Athlete sports            | `find -as Basketball` |
| `-on` | Organization names        | `find -on Nike`       |
| `-ca` | Contracts by athlete name | `find -ca LeBron`     |
| `-cs` | Contracts by sport        | `find -cs Basketball` |
| `-co` | Contracts by organization | `find -co Nike`       |

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

**Examples:**

```
find -an James          # Find athletes with names like "James"
find -as Basketball     # Find athletes with sports like "Basketball"
find -on Nike           # Find organizations with names like "Nike"
find -ca LeBron         # Find contracts with athletes named like "LeBron"
find -cs Basketball     # Find all contracts athletes' sports named like "Basketball"
find -co Nike           # Find contracts with organizations like "Nike"
```

**Expected Output for `find -an James`:**

```
Showing 1 athlete closely matching "James".
You can refresh the display anytime using Cmd+R (macOS) or Ctrl+R (Windows/Linux) to show all data again.
```
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:**
- After a find command, the filtered list in the active tab does not refresh automatically if you add or delete an athlete, organization, or contract. The list still shows the previous results until refresh is executed. However, any updated details (e.g., contract amounts) are reflected in the displayed entries. 
- Running another find clears the old results and shows a new filtered list based on the latest criteria.
- Only 1 filter can be applied at all times.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**üí° Fuzzy Matching Features:**

- **Exact matches**: "Nike" will find "Nike" instantly
- **Substring matches**: "Man" will find "Manchester United"
- **Typo tolerance**: "Messy" will find "Messi" (1-2 character differences allowed)
- **Case insensitive**: "NIKE" and "nike" both work

</div>

#### Clearing Search Results

**Command:** `refresh`

Use this command to clear any active search filters and return to viewing all data.

**Keyboard Shortcut:** **Cmd+R** (macOS) or **Ctrl+R** (Windows/Linux)

**Expected Output:**

```

```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**üí° Tip:**
You can refresh the display anytime using **Cmd+R** (macOS) or **Ctrl+R** (Windows/Linux).

</div>

### Application Controls

### Parameter Details

**Common Parameters:**

- `NAME`: Full Name (spaces allowed, case-insensitive; accepts alphabetic characters, hyphens, and apostrophes; must start with a letter; maximum of 50 characters, including spaces)
   - Character restrictions: Only letters, hyphens (-), and apostrophes (') are allowed to accommodate legitimate name formats like "O'Brien", "Mary-Jane", or "Jean-Claude" while preventing special characters that could cause display or data processing issues.
   - Limitation rationale: The 50-character limit accommodates most athlete names while preventing extremely long entries that could affect display formatting and system performance.
- `SPORT`: Sport (spaces allowed, case-insensitive; alphabetic characters only; maximum of 50 characters)
   - Character restrictions: Only letters are allowed to maintain consistency in sport names and prevent formatting issues.
   - Limitation rationale: The 50-character limit covers all major sports names and disciplines while preventing extremely long entries that could affect display formatting and system performance.

   - Limitation rationale: The 50-character limit covers most professional email addresses while preventing excessively long entries.
- `DATE`: Date (must be in the DDMMYYYY format)
   - Format rationale: The DDMMYYYY format is commonly used in Singapore and avoids ambiguity in date interpretation.
- `AMOUNT`: Amount (positive integers only; supports large values up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807; no currency symbols or commas)
   - Currency: All amounts are in Singapore Dollars (SGD)

## Tips and Best Practices

### Effective Workflows

**Daily Management:**

1. Start each day with `refresh` to see all your data
2. Use `find -an [name]` to quickly locate specific athletes
3. Check contract expiry dates regularly with `find -cs [sport]`
4. Keep contact information updated for all entities

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

**Contract Negotiation Season:**

1. Use `find -ca [athlete]` to see all contracts for an athlete
2. Cross-reference with `find -co [organization]` to see organization's other deals
3. Track contract amounts and dates systematically
4. Add new contracts immediately after signing

**Data Organization:**

- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., "FC Barcelona" vs "Barcelona FC")
- Include full legal names for organizations
- Keep email and phone information current
- Group related contracts by using similar start/end date patterns

### Common Pitfalls & Solutions

**Problem:** "Error: Athlete not found" when adding contracts
**Solution:** Use `find -an [name]` first to verify the exact name spelling

**Problem:** Too many search results
**Solution:** Use more specific keywords or combine with tab switching

**Problem:** Slow performance with large datasets
**Solution:** Use search filters regularly instead of browsing all data

**Problem:** App behaves unexpectedly after deleting files
**Solution:** Never delete individual JSON files in the `data` folder.
If you need to reset your data, delete the entire folder instead.

## Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions

### Common Error Messages

**"Error: Unknown command"**

- Check spelling of command name
- Ensure you're using the correct flags (e.g., `-an` not `-name`)
- See [Command Reference](#command-reference) for exact syntax

**"Error: Athlete/Organization/Contract not found"**

- Use `find` commands to locate the exact name
- Check for typos or extra spaces

**"Error: This Athlete/Organization/Contract already exists in playbook.io"**

- Athlete name + sport combinations must be unique
- Organization names must be unique
- Contracts must have unique parameter combinations
- Try slightly different name variations if needed

**"Error: Amount should be a numeric integer between 1 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807(inclusive). 
Do not include currency symbols or commas.**
- Contract amounts must be positive integers only
- Maximum supported amount: 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
- No commas, currency symbols, or decimal points allowed (e.g., 9223372036854775807 for 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
- Use whole numbers only (e.g., 50000000 for $50 million)

### Performance Issues

**Large datasets (1000+ entries):**

- Use search filters instead of browsing all data
- Close and restart the application weekly
- Consider archiving old contracts to separate files

**Slow startup:**

- Check available disk space (need 50MB minimum)
- Ensure Java version is 17 or higher
- Try moving to a different folder location

### Frequently Asked Questions
**Why can't I use my international phone numbers?**    

playbook.io is designed for agents operating in Singapore and currently supports only 8-digit Singapore phone numbers. This ensures data consistency and simplifies local operations.

**Can I track contracts in different currencies?**  

All contract amounts are in Singapore Dollars (SGD). If you need to track international contracts, we recommend converting amounts to SGD at the time of entry.

**Why does the system say "duplicate athlete" when I'm adding someone with a different phone number?**  

Athletes are identified by their name and sport combination, not by contact details. This is because athletes often share managers or have contact details managed by agencies. If you need to add an athlete with the same name, they must be in a different sport. We intentionally avoid using more specific identifiers like NRIC numbers, as doing so would improve duplicate detection but require collecting sensitive personal data, increasing privacy risks and regulatory compliance obligations.

**Can an athlete and an organization have the same phone number or email?**  

Yes, this is allowed and intentional. Athletes and organizations are separate entities in the system, and it's common in practice for them to share contact details. This flexibility reflects real-world scenarios where contact information overlaps between different entities you manage.

**Can I edit athlete, organization, or contract information after adding them?**  
No, editing is not allowed for athletes, organizations, or contracts once they've been added to the system. If you need to make changes or entered incorrect information, please delete the entry and create a new one with the correct details.

### Why can't the total contract amount exceed 9,223,372,036,854,775,807?

This is the maximum value for a 64-bit integer (`Long.MAX_VALUE`) in Java, which is the largest whole number the system can handle. Realistically, this number (over 9 quintillion) far exceeds the total amount of money in the world, so it's highly unlikely you'll ever encounter this limit in practice. This constraint exists purely as a technical limitation of the programming language used.
